	- *Shortened Abstract: Improved methods for effectively representing and generating all graphs in a space defined by certain complex specifications are presented. These improvements are realized through enhancements to the original perfect matching-inspired approach utilizing a component catalog definition to capture the graphs of interest. These enhancements will come in many forms, including more efficient graph enumeration and labeled graph isomorphism checking, expansion of the definition of the component catalog, and the effective inclusion of new network structure constraints. Several examples are shown, including improvements to the original case studies (with up to 971x reduction in computational cost) as well as graph problems in common system architecture design patterns.*

	- *Shortened Abstract: A class of architecture design problems is explored with perfect matchings (PMs). A perfect matching in a graph is a set of edges such that every vertex is present in exactly one edge. The perfect matching approach has many desirable properties such as complete design space coverage. Improving on the pure perfect matching approach, a tree search algorithm is developed that more efficiently covers the same design space. The effect of specific network structure constraints (NSCs) and labeled graph isomorphisms on the desired design space is demonstrated. This is accomplished by determining all unique feasible graphs for a select number of architecture problems, explicitly demonstrating the specific challenges of architecture design. With this methodology, it is possible to enumerate all possible architectures for moderate scale-systems.*
