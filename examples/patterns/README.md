## Patterns

These six patterns are defined in the following paper:
- D Selva, B Cameron, and E Crawley. **Patterns in System Architecture Decisions**. Syst Eng, vol. 19, no. 6, pp. 477â€“497, Nov. 2016. [[DOI]](https://doi.org/10.1002/sys.21370)

The implementation of these patterns using the PM Architectures project are described in the following paper, including some of the additional constrained examples:
- DR Herber. **Enhancements to the perfect matching approach for graph enumeration-based engineering challenges**. In ASME 2020 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences, DETC2020-22774, Aug. 2020.
